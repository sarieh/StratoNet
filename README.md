# StratoNet: NASA-API based Network Application (University project)
This project work is about the application layer of the network protocol stack. It involves application layer software development, client/server protocol, application layer protocol principles, socket programming, and multithreading

In this project, we were are asked to develop a NASA-API based network application protocol based on the client/server model. 
StratoNet server provides two types of TCP connections to interact with the clients: One connection for exchanging the protocol commands, and one for data transfers. Only the StratoNet server interacts with the NASA API web server and provides the StratoNet client with the information extracted
